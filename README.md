XDP2 (eXpress DataPath 2)
=========================

**XDP2** is a software programming model, framework, set of libraries, and an
API used to program the high performance datapath. In networking, XDP2 is
applied to optimize packet and protocol processing.

Jump [here](#Building-src) if you'd like to skip to building the code.

Contact information
===================

For more information, inquiries, or comments about the XDP2 project please
send to the XDP2 mailing list xdp2@lists.linux.dev.

Description
===========

This repository contains the code base for the XDP2 project. The XDP2 code
is composed of a number of C libraries, include files for the API, scripts,
test code, and sample code.

Relationship to XDP
===================

XDP2 can be thought of as a generalization of XDP. Where XDP is a facility
for programming the low level datapath from device drivers, XDP2 extends
the model to program programmable hardware as well as software environments
that are not eBPF like DPDK. XDP2 retains the spirit of XDP in an easy-to-use
programming model, as well as the general look and feel of XDP. The XDP2
API is a bit more generic than XDP and abstracts out target specific items.
XDP is a first class target of XDP (see XDP2 samples). Converting an XDP
program to XDP2 should mostly be a matter of adapting the code to the XDP2
API and splitting out required XDP code like glue code.

Directory structure
===================

The top level directories are:

* **src**: contains source code for libraries, the XDP2 API, and test code
* **samples**: contains standalone example applications that use the XDP2 API
* **documentation**: contains documentation for XDP2
* **platforms**: contains platform definitions. Currently a default platform
is supported
* **thirdparty**: contains third party code include pcap library

Nix Development Environment (Experimental)
==========================================

**New in October 2024**: XDP2 now includes an experimental Nix development environment that provides a reproducible, isolated development setup. This eliminates dependency conflicts and ensures consistent builds across all machines.  We would love feedback about the Nix development environment to xdp2@lists.linux.dev.

For detailed instructions, troubleshooting, and technical details, see the [Nix Development Environment Guide](documentation/nix/nix.md).

> **Note**: This is an experimental feature. The traditional build process (described below) remains the primary method for building XDP2.

Building-src
============

The XDP source is built by doing a make in the top level source directory.

Prerequisites
-------------

To install the basic development prerequisites on Ubuntu 20.10 or up we need to install the following packages:

```
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential gcc-multilib pkg-config bison flex libboost-all-dev libpcap-dev python3-scapy
```

If you want to generate graph visualizations from the xdp2 compiler you must
install the graphviz package:

```
sudo apt-get install -y graphviz
```

If you intend use the optimized compiler or build XDP samples then you must
install the dependencies to compile and load BPF programs as described below:

```
sudo apt-get install -y libelf-dev clang clang-tools libclang-dev llvm llvm-dev libbpf-dev linux-tools-$(uname -r)
```

Because the linux tools is dependent on the kernel version, you should use the
**uname -r** command to get the current kernel version as shown above.

For XDP, we recommend a minimum Linux kernel version of 5.8, which is available on Ubuntu 20.10 and up.

Configure
---------

The *configure* script in the source directory is ran to configure the
build process. The usage is:

```
$ ./configure --help

$ ./configure --help

Usage: ./configure [--config-defines <defines>] [--ccarch <arch>]
 [--arch <arch>] [--compiler <compiler>]
 [--installdir <dir>] [--build-opt-parser]
 [--pkg-config-path <path>] [--python-ver <version>]
 [--llvm-config <llvm-config>]
```

Parameters:

* **--config-defines <defines>** set compiler defines with format
  "**-D**\<*name*\>=\<*val*\> ..."
* **--ccarch <arch>** set cross compiler architecture (cross compilation will
be supported in the future)
* **--arch <arch>** set architecture. Currently *x84_64* is supported
* **--compiler <compiler>** set the compiler. Default is *gcc*, *clang* is
an alternative
* **--installdir** install directory
* **--build-opt-parser** build the optimized parser (see **xdp-compiler**
below)
* **--pkg-config-path <path>** set Python package config path
* **--python-ver <version>** sets the Python version
* **--llvm-config <llvm-config>** set the LLVM config command. The default
is */usr/bin/llvm-config*. This is only used if **--build-opt-parser** is set

Examples:

Run configure with no arguments
```

$ ./configure

Setting default compiler as gcc for native builds

Platform is default
Architecture is x86_64
Architecture includes for x86_64 not found, using generic
Target Architecture is
COMPILER is gcc
XDP2_CLANG_VERSION=14.0.0
XDP2_C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-14/lib/clang/14/include
XDP2_CLANG_RESOURCE_PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-14/lib/clang/14
```

Run configure with build optimized parser, an install directory,
an LLVM config program, and use clang as the compiler:
```
./configure --installdir ~/xdp2/install --build-opt-parser --llvm-config /usr/bin/llvm-config-20 --compiler clang


Platform is default
Architecture is x86_64
Architecture includes for x86_64 not found, using generic
Target Architecture is
COMPILER is clang
^[[OXDP2_CLANG_VERSION=20.1.8
XDP2_C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-20/lib/clang/20/include
XDP2_CLANG_RESOURCE_PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-20/lib/clang/20
```

## Make

Building of the main libraries and code is performed by doing make in the
**src** directory:

```
make
```

The compiled libraries, header files, and binaries may be installed in
the installation directory specified by *configure**:
```
make install
```

To get verbose output from make add **V=1** to the command line. Additional
CFLAGS may be set by using CCOPTS in the command line:

```
$ make CCOPTS=-O3

$ make CCOPTS=-g
```

Building samples
================

Before building samples the main source must be built and installed. Note that
*samples/xdp* requires that the optimized parser was built. Sample are built
by:
```
make XDP2DIR=<install-dir>
```

where *\<install-dir\>* is the installation directory for XDP2.

For more information consult the README files in the *samples* directory.

Test
====

The XDP2 tests are built as part of XDP build. They are installed in
*\<install-dir\>/bin/test_\** where \* is replaced by the test name. For
instance:

```
$ ls ~/xdp2/install/bin
ls ~/xdp2/install/bin
parse_dump  test_accel   test_parser  test_router  test_tables  test_vstructs
pmacro_gen  test_bitmap  test_pvbuf   test_switch  test_timer
```

Most of the tests are documented in the *documentation* directory (under the
service descriptions)

# Basic validation testing

To perform basic validation of the parser do

**cd src/test/parser**

**run-tests.sh**

The output should show the the parsers being run with no reported diffs or
other errors.

For more information on the parser test please see
[testing](documentation/test-parser.md).
